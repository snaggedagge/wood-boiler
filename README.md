# Wood burning boiler (Vedpanna)

A small Arduino project running on ESP8266 nodemcu to power my boiler.

Uses one MAX6675 temperature sensor for the water temperature, and another one for the exhaust temperature.

This controls a relay which powers the exhaust fan. Exhaust fan is stopped once the boiler has cooled down once again.

Information is displayed on a 128 x 64 pixel SH1106 OLED display, with nice symbols etc.

Pictures coming up...
